# ðŸ–± Selenium WebElement â€“ Theory

## What is a WebElement?
A WebElement in Selenium represents an HTML element on a web page, such as buttons, input fields, links, etc.

---

## Key Points
- Every interactive element on a page can be captured as a WebElement.
- WebElements are located using locators such as `id`, `name`, `xpath`, etc.
- Once located, we can perform actions like click, type, or get text.

## Common WebElement Actions
- `click()` â€“ Clicks on an element.
- `sendKeys()` â€“ Types into an input field.
- `getText()` â€“ Gets the visible text of an element.
- `isDisplayed()` â€“ Checks if the element is visible.
