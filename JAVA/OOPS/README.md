# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach where we design and structure our code around **objects** rather than actions.  
Java is a pure object-oriented language (except for primitive types) and supports all OOP principles.

The **4 main pillars** of OOP in Java are:
1. [Encapsulation](Encapsulation.md)
2. [Inheritance](Inheritance.md)
3. [Polymorphism](Polymorphism.md)
4. [Abstraction](Abstraction.md)
