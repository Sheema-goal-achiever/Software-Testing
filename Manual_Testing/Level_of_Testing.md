# ðŸ§ª Levels of Software Testing

In software testing, we donâ€™t test everything at once. Instead, we test the software in **stages**, from small pieces to the full product. These stages are called **Levels of Testing**.

There are **4 main levels** of software testing:

---

### 1. **Unit Testing**

**âœ… What is it?**  
Testing the **smallest parts** of the software â€” usually individual functions or methods.

**ðŸ”§ Who performs it?**  
Developers

**ðŸ§ª Example:**  
Checking if a "login function" returns the correct result when given valid and invalid usernames/passwords.

---

### 2. **Integration Testing**

**âœ… What is it?**  
Testing how different **units (modules)** work together when combined.

**ðŸ”§ Who performs it?**  
Developers or testers

**ðŸ§ª Example:**  
Checking if the login page connects properly to the user database.

---

### 3. **System Testing**

**âœ… What is it?**  
Testing the **entire software system** as a whole to check if it meets the requirements.

**ðŸ”§ Who performs it?**  
Testers

**ðŸ§ª Example:**  
Testing the full application â€” login, home page, user settings, logout â€” to see if everything works together.

---

### 4. **Acceptance Testing**

**âœ… What is it?**  
Testing to confirm that the software is **ready to be delivered to the customer**. It checks if it solves the real-world problem it was built for.

**ðŸ”§ Who performs it?**  
Clients, stakeholders, or testers

**ðŸ§ª Example:**  
A business owner uses the app to check if it works as expected before accepting the final product.

| Level               | What is tested               | Who tests it         | Goal                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Unit Testing         | Individual functions/modules  | Developers           | Find early bugs in code         |
| Integration Testing  | Interaction between modules   | Developers/Testers   | Check data flow between units   |
| System Testing       | Entire software system        | Testers              | Ensure complete system works    |
| Acceptance Testing   | Final product                 | Clients/Stakeholders | Ensure client needs are met     |
