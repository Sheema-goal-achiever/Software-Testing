# 🧪 Manual Testing

Manual testing is the process of manually checking software for defects without the use of automation tools.  
The tester plays the role of an end-user and verifies whether the application works as expected by executing test cases.  
It ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of critical bugs before release.
