# üñêÔ∏è Types of Manual Testing

Manual testing can be done in several ways depending on **what** we are checking and **why** we are testing.  
Here are the main types:

---

## 1. **Black Box Testing**
- **What it is:** Testing the software **without knowing how it works inside** (no access to code).
- **Focus:** Inputs and outputs.
- **Example:** Entering a password in a login form and checking if it logs in correctly.

---

## 2. **White Box Testing**
- **What it is:** Testing the software **by looking inside the code** and understanding its structure.
- **Focus:** Internal logic, code paths.
- **Example:** A developer checking if all branches of an `if-else` statement work.

---

## 3. **Unit Testing**
- **What it is:** Testing **individual components** or modules of the software.
- **Focus:** One small part at a time.
- **Example:** Testing a single function that calculates tax.

---

## 4. **Integration Testing**
- **What it is:** Testing how **different modules work together**.
- **Focus:** Data flow and interaction between parts.
- **Example:** Checking if the login module works correctly with the user dashboard.

---

## 5. **System Testing**
- **What it is:** Testing the **whole software** as a complete system.
- **Focus:** End-to-end functionality.
- **Example:** Testing a shopping website from adding a product to making payment.

---

## 6. **Acceptance Testing**
- **What it is:** Testing to see if the software **meets the customer‚Äôs needs**.
- **Focus:** Real-world use cases.
- **Example:** A client using the app to ensure it matches their requirements.
