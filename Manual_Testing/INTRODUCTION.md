# Introduction to Software Testing

**What is Software Testing?**  
Software Testing is the process of checking whether a website or application works correctly, is free from defects (bugs), and meets the required expectations.

It helps ensure that:
- The software functions as intended
- It provides a smooth user experience
- Errors are caught before users face them

# Principles of Software Testing

Here are the **7 core principles** of software testing, explained simply:

1. **Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence**  
   Testing helps find bugs, but even if no bugs are found, it doesn’t mean the software is perfect.

2. **Exhaustive testing is not possible**  
   You cannot test everything. So, we test smartly — by choosing important and likely areas where bugs may occur.

3. **Early testing saves time and money**  
   The sooner we test (even during planning or designing), the cheaper and easier it is to fix mistakes.

4. **Defects cluster together**  
   Most bugs are often found in a few specific areas of the software. These areas need more attention.

5. **Beware of the pesticide paradox**  
   Running the same tests repeatedly won’t find new bugs. We must update or add new test cases to find fresh defects.

6. **Testing is context dependent**  
   The way we test depends on the type of software. For example, testing a banking app is different from testing a game.

7. **Absence of errors is a fallacy**  
   Just because a software has no bugs doesn’t mean it’s useful. It must also meet user needs and business goals.

# Verification vs Validation

**🔍 Verification** and **✅ Validation** are two key steps in software testing. Both are used to make sure the software is correct — but in different ways.

---

### 🔍 What is Verification?

**Verification** means **checking whether we are building the software correctly**.

- It focuses on **processes, designs, and documents**
- Happens **before actual coding or execution**
- Answers the question: **"Are we building it right?"**

🛠️ Example: Reviewing the design, requirements, or code — without running the program.

### ✅ What is Validation?

**Validation** means **checking whether we built the right software**.

- It focuses on the **actual product or output**
- Happens **after the software is developed**
- Answers the question: **"Did we build the right thing?"**

🧪 Example: Running the application and testing if it behaves as expected.
